Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter,
for example: `"abc" -> "bcd"`. We can keep "shifting" which forms the
sequence:

    
    
    "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"

Given a list of non-empty strings which contains only lowercase alphabets,
group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

Example:

    
    
    Input: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],
    Output: 
    [
      ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
      ["az","ba"],
      ["acef"],
      ["a","z"]
    ]
